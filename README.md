# DFE_API_Project
o	Why are we doing this?
 creating a backend database project to test what I have learnt from the bootcamp
o	How I expected the challenge to go.
It was harder than i expected as i came across a few errors.
o	What went well? / What didn't go as planned?
what went well - creating a Jira board, using postman
What didn't go as planned- creating lots of syntax errors
o	Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.
include stretch goals for more features in this API
o	Screenshots showing your postman requests and the output from the API.
